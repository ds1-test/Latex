	\section{What is LaTeX?} 
	LaTeX is a powerful system for creating high-quality typeset documents. Unlike 
	familiar word processors like Microsoft Word, LaTeX doesn't use a \textit{What-you
		see-is-what-you-get} (WYSIWYG) approach. Instead, you write your document using 
	plain text interspersed with special commands that tell LaTeX how to format the final 
	output. 
	\section{Core concepts of LaTeX} 
	LaTeX is the markup language used for the typesetting of the technical 
	documents. To learn LaTeX, you must have a great idea of MS Word and the way or 
	
	method which you use to design your document. It also needs an understanding of 
	mathematics and related commands. 
	\section{Key features of LaTeX} 
	
	\textbf{Emphasis on Content:} LaTeX encourages you to focus on writing by 
	handling formatting through commands. This can be particularly beneficial for complex 
	documents with intricate structures.\\ 
	\textbf{Typesetting Prowess:} LaTeX excels at handling mathematical \\
	equations, symbols, and scientific notation. It produces crisp, high-quality output that 
	adheres to professional publishing standards.\\ 
	\textbf{Citations and References:} LaTeX makes managing citations and 
	references a breeze. You can easily insert citations and let LaTeX take care of 
	generating a formatted bibliography at the end.\\ 
	\textbf{Customization Power:} LaTeX offers extensive customization options. 
	You can define document styles, create custom commands, and leverage a vast library 
	of packages to achieve nearly any desired formatting.\\ 
	
	\section{Workflow} 
	
	\textbf{Writing the Document:} You write your content in a plain text editor, 
	adding LaTeX commands to structure your text by specifying things like sections, lists, 
	and formatting.\\ 
	\textbf{Compiling the Document:} Once you've written your document, you 
	run it through a Latex complier.This translates your code and commands into the 
	final formatted document, typically a PDF file.\\ 
	\textbf{Editing and Recompiling:} The editing process in Latex in iterative. You 
	make changes to your plain text file, recompile, and preview the updated document 
	until you achieve the desired output.\\
